# autostrafe
roblox surf autostrafe script, pretty shit but yea

i coded all of it, but code was so unreadable i made ai add comments in it 💔

the slider at the bottom doesnt work in the roblox menu so just open chat and then you can move the slider.

works in https://www.roblox.com/games/5315066937/surf and https://www.roblox.com/games/5315046213/bhop if you find any other game it works in, great ig?
